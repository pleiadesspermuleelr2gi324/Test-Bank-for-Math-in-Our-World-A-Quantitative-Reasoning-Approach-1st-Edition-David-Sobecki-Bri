  * What does quantitative reasoning really mean? Is it just liberal arts math with a new name on the cover of the book? We say that it is not. It is about students productively struggling with context-based problems. It is not just learning how to do math problems, but more importantly learning how quantitative thinking is applied throughout the curriculum, and throughout a lifetime.
